# Name of the project

> Additional information or tag line

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

## Authors

Who's worked on the development of this project and what was their role? Just incase theres an issue.

## Environments

Make a list of the ENVs we have

- Staging â€“ [the-link-to-staging](my-staging-server)

## Developing

### Built With

List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Nextjs etc...)

### Prerequisites

What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links. 

** REALLY IMPORTANT ** Absolutely 100% document the version of node you're using, you never know when a project will be resurrected. You could also make an `.nvmrc` file in the repo too.

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

## Deploying / Publishing

give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

## Documentation

Create a small list like below to link to parts of your documentation wherever they are (they're probably in notion)

- [API Reference](my-link-example)
