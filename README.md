# Companion Scripts

This is the monorepo for [Companion Studio](https://www.companion.studio/) script packages.
This just helps set up a project quicker and more consistently, be enforcing the same `eslint`, `prettier` configs and then using `husky` to make sure they're actually used in a project.

We've got:

- [`@studiocompanion/scripts`](/packages/scripts)
- [`@studiocompanion/eslint-config`](/packages/eslint-config)
- [`@studiocompanion/prettier`](/packages/prettier)
- [`@studiocompanion/husky`](/packages/husky)

If you've got an idea for a new one we'd find useful, why not submit a PR!
